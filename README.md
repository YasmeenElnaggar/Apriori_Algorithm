Big Data Course

In this project we are going to apply Apriori algorithm to find all the association rules in the given
dataset. The dataset itself represents the customer data for an insurance company; it has 86 attributes
with 5822 records.

Our task is to find all the possible association rules for user-defined values of support and
confidence. Additionally, we need to compute the lift and leverage for each rule so that you
prioritize the rules.
The dataset and the description of its attributes are available at
http://www.liacs.nl/~putten/library/cc2000/.
